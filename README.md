# üí≥ Fraud Detection System

An end-to-end machine learning system for detecting credit card fraud transactions, with a Flask API backend and web interface.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Backend & Machine Learning (Solo Work)
- **Data Processing**:
  - Handled class imbalance using SMOTE and Random Under-Sampling
  - Feature scaling with StandardScaler (persisted for inference)
- **Model Training**:
  - Compared Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost
  - Selected Random Forest (best F1-score: 0.91)
  - Serialized model and scaler using pickle
- **API Development**:
  - Built Flask server with two endpoints:
    - `GET /` - Serves the frontend
    - `POST /predict` - Handles fraud predictions
  - CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
  - Docker containerization

### Frontend (Contributed by Deepsick)
- Clean responsive interface with form validation
- Dynamic result display with visual feedback
- Error handling and loading states
- Modern CSS styling

## üöÄ Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Docker (optional)

### Running Locally
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Train model (generates model.pkl and scaler.pkl)
python src/train.py

# Start Flask server
python src/app.py 
```

### With Docker
```
docker build -t fraud-detection .
docker run -p 8000:8000 fraud-detection
```

### Notes
- The frontend interface was collaboratively developed with DEEPSICK.
